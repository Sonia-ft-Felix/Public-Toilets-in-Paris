# Public-Toilets-in-Paris
## Repartition of public toilets in Paris
If you want to know where is the closest public toilet in Paris you can download an app for 0,83â‚¬ on Apple Store that references 200 public toilets, or ... you can go for free on the open data portal of the city of Paris and find the exact location of ALL of the public toilets.
In this repository you will find maps of the areas where it is the easiest and the hardest to find public toilets. Spoiler alert: if you want to find a public toilet you better be in a left wing neighborhood!
On a more serious note, we also show that this data set respects every open data principle but lacks of entrenchment in a long-term vision of open-government policy.
